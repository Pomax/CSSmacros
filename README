// Use Macros ("constants" or "set-once variables") in CSS
// -------------------------------------------------------

This JavaScript library lets you use macros in your CSS
files, using the following CSS-accepted syntax:

  @macros {
    macro_1: value_1;
    macro_2: value_2;
    macro_3: value_3;
    macro_4: value_4;
  }

  element {
    some-property: macro_1
  }

  .class {
    some-property: macro_2;
  }

  #id {
    some-property: macro_3;
  }

  *:pseudo-class {
    some-property: macro_4;
  }

Browsers that don't support JavaScript stylesheet
manipulation, as well as browsers that have scripts
disabled, will load CSS files that use macros just
fine, but will ignore any rule that uses a macro
as property value, so things don't break in older
browsers, but you will need to declare fallback
rules (preceding the macro override) for any rule
that should have some specific value when there is no
javascript available (much like how we design modern
web pages already anyway).
